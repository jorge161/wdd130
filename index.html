        <p>Honduras is a country located in Central America, known for its rich culture and natural beauty. Its capital
            is
            Tegucigalpa, and its economy is based on agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. The country has coasts on
            both the
            Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, giving it great geographical diversity. It is famous for the Mayan
            ruins of Copán,
            the beaches of Roatán, and its biodiversity. Although it faces economic and social challenges, its people
            are known for
            their warmth and traditions.</p>
